    "<b> NOTE: </b> Webscraping may be against the terms and conditions of some websites (Yelp, FB, etc). Sometimes it's because they offer the services for a fee (Twitter, Facebook, etc) - so if you really want the information and really don't want to break the terms & conditions (or get your IP address banned from the website), you can try getting the information through the recommended sources. The rules are really made to prevent people from doing mass scrapings for profit - I doubt they would bother tracking down the graduate student scraping one or two pages for educational purposes. \n",
