# CSCI-E-7-Section-1-Intro-to-Python

Welcome to some of my course material for CSCI E-7 Section 1: Introduction to Programming with Python at Harvard University. This repository contains most of my work from the course, including my final project.

Course Description This course is an introduction to computer science and programming, designed for students with little or no experience. The course will cover the fundamental concepts of computer science, including algorithms and data structures, as well as the Python programming language. By the end of the course, students will be able to write simple programs and understand the basics of computing.

Getting Started To get started, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You can download it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have Python installed, you can begin working on the assignments and exercises provided in this repository. Each assignment has a corresponding Jupyter notebook that contains instructions and code templates for you to complete.
